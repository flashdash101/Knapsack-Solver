# Knapsack-Solver


## Description
A dynamic Knapsack Solver program which takes in user inputs for values, weights, and weight limits, delivering a binary solution and objective value, maximizing resource utilization.

## pre-requisite requirements:
Install the following modules: Tkinter, MatplotLib, Random and unittest using 'pip install [module name]'

## Testing
Unit testing was done through a module called unittest which is used in a seperate files which calls from my main project file to call the algorithm and test if it works.

## How to use
There is a help button which briefly explains how to use the program in simple steps!

## Future work
* More ways to visualise the output, i have implemented a basic graph for now but it doesn't really do justice.
* Maybe use different optimization algorithms.
